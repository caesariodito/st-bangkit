## Exploring how to use data

Machine Learning depends on having good data to train a system with. In the previous video, you were given a scenario to train a system to recognize fashion images. The data comes from a dataset called Fashion MNIST, and you can learn more about it on GitHub here. In the next video, you’ll see how to load that data and prepare it for training.

## The structure of Fashion MNIST data

Here you saw how the data can be loaded into Python data structures that make it easy to train a neural network. You saw how the image is represented as a 28x28 array of greyscales, and how its label is a number. Using a number is a first step in avoiding bias -- instead of labelling it with words in a specific language and excluding people who don’t speak that language! You can learn more about bias and techniques to avoid it here.
